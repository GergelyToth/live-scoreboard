# Assumptions

- Assuming from the wording of the requirements, that only one live match can be active at any given point.
- the update score therefore will update the only ongoing/live match, without the need for an additional parameter to specify the match in question
- Added a display function to the method for ease of testing, where the no ongoing match string can be modified to fit any upcoming requirement if needed.
